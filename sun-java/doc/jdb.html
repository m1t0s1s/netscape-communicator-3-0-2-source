<h1>jdb - The Java Debugger</h1>
<blockquote>
<b>jdb</b> helps you find and fix bugs in Java language programs.
</blockquote>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
jdb [ <a href="jdb.html#Options">options</a> ]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<blockquote>
The Java Debugger, <b>jdb</b>, is a dbx-like command-line debugger for Java 
classes. It uses the <a href="../doc/api/sun.tools.debug.html">Java Debugger API</a>
to provide inspection and debugging of a local or remote Java interpreter.
<p>

<h3>Starting a jdb Session</h3>
<blockquote>
Like dbx, there are two ways <b>jdb</b> can be used for debugging. The most
frequently used way is to have <b>jdb</b> start the Java interpreter with
the class to be debugged. This is done by substituting the command <b>jdb</b>
for <b>java</b> in the command line. For example, to start HotJava under
<b>jdb</b>, you use the following: 

<blockquote>
<pre width=80>
% jdb browser.hotjava
</pre>
</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>
<pre width=80>
% jdb -classpath $INSTALL_DIR/classes -ms4m browser.hotjava
</pre>
</blockquote>
When started this way, <b>jdb</b> invokes a second Java interpreter with any
specified parameters, loads the specified class, and stops before executing
that class's first instruction.

<p>
The second way to use <b>jdb</b> is by attaching it to a Java interpreter
that is already running. For security reasons, Java interpreters can only
be debugged if they have been started with the <i>-debug</i> option.
When started with the <i>-debug</i> option, the Java interpreter prints
out a password for <b>jdb</b>'s use.

<p>
To attach <b>jdb</b> to a running Java interpreter (once the session 
password is known), invoke it as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre width=80>
% jdb -host &lt;hostname&gt; -password &lt;password&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>Basic jdb Commands</h3>
The following is a list of the basic <b>jdb</b> commands. The Java debugger
supports other commands which you can list using <b>jdb</b>'s <tt>help</tt>
command.
<p>
<em>NOTE: To browse local (stack) variables, the class must have been
compiled with the <i>-g</i> option.</em>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>help</b>, or <b>?</b>
<dd>
The most important <b>jdb</b> command, <tt>help</tt> displays the list of
recognized commands with a brief description.

<dt><b>print</b>
<dd>
Browses Java objects. The <tt>print</tt> command calls the object's
<tt>toString()</tt> method, so it will be formatted differently depending
on its class.
<p>
Classes are specified by either their object ID or by name. If a class is 
already loaded, a substring can be used, such as <tt>Thread</tt> for 
<tt>java.lang.Thread</tt>. If a class isn't loaded, its full name must be
specified, and the class will be loaded as a side effect. This is needed
to set breakpoints in referenced classes before an applet runs.
<p>
<tt>print</tt> supports Java expressions, such as <tt>print MyClass.clsVar</tt>.
Method invocation will <em>not</em> be supported in the 1.0 release, however, 
as the compiler needs to be enhanced first.
<p>

<dt><b>dump</b>
<dd>
Dumps an object's instance variables. Objects are specified by their
object ID (a hexadecimal integer).
<p>
Classes are specified by either their object ID or by name. If a class is 
already loaded, a substring can be used, such as <tt>Thread</tt> for 
<tt>java.lang.Thread</tt>. If a class isn't loaded, its full name must be
specified, and the class will be loaded as a side effect. This is needed
to set breakpoints in referenced classes before an applet runs.
<p>
The <tt>dump</tt> command supports Java expressions such as
<tt>dump 0x12345678.myCache[3].foo</tt>. Method invocation will <em>not</em>
be supported in the 1.0 release, however, as the compiler needs to be enhanced
first.
<p>

<dt><b>threads</b>
<dd>
Lists the current threads. This lists all threads in the default threadgroup,
which is normally the first non-system group. (The <tt>threadgroups</tt> command
lists all threadgroups.) Threads are referenced by their object ID, or if they
are in the default thread group, with the form <tt>t@&lt;index&gt;</tt>, such
as <tt>t@3</tt>.
<p>

<dt><b>where</b>
<dd>
Dumps the stack of either a specified thread, or the current thread (which is
set with the <tt>thread</tt> command). If that thread is suspended (either
because it's at a breakpoint or via the <tt>suspend</tt> command), local
(stack) and instance variables can be browsed with the <tt>print</tt> and
<tt>dump</tt> commands. The <tt>up</tt> and <tt>down</tt> commands select
which stack frame is current.

</dl>
</blockquote>

<h3>Breakpoints</h3>
<blockquote>
Breakpoints are set in <b>jdb</b> in classes, such as "<tt>stop at MyClass:45</tt>".
The source file line number must be specified, or the name of the method (the
breakpoint will then be set at the first instruction of that method). The
<tt>clear</tt> command removes breakpoints using a similar syntax, while the
<tt>cont</tt> command continues execution.
<p>
Single-stepping is not currently implemented, but is hoped to be available
for version 1.0.
</blockquote>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<blockquote>
When an exception occurs for which there isn't a catch statement anywhere up
a Java program's stack, the Java runtime normally dumps an exception trace
and exits. When running under <b>jdb</b>, however, that exception is
treated as a non-recoverable breakpoint, and <b>jdb</b> stops at the 
offending instruction. If that class was compiled with the <i>-g</i>
option, instance and local variables can be printed to determine the cause
of the exception.

<p>
Specific exceptions may be optionally debugged with the <tt>catch</tt> command,
for example: "<tt>catch FileNotFoundException</tt>" or 
"<tt>catch mypackage.BigTroubleException</tt>. The Java debugging facility 
keeps a list of these exceptions, and when one is thrown, it is treated as if 
a breakpoint was set on the instruction which caused the exception. 
The <tt>ignore</tt> command removes exception classes from this list.

<p>
<em>NOTE: The <tt>ignore</tt> command does not cause the Java interpreter
to ignore specific exceptions, only the debugger.</em>

<a name=Options>
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>
When you use <b>jdb</b> in place of the Java interpreter on the command line
<b>jdb</b> accepts the same options as the <a href="java.html">java</a> command.

<p>
When you use <b>jdb</b> to attach to a running Java interpreter session,
<b>jdb</b> accepts these options:

<dl>
<dt><b>-host <i>&lt;hostname&gt;</i></b>
<dd>
Sets the name of the host machine on which the interpreter session to attach
to is running.

<dt><b>-password <i>&lt;password&gt;</i></b>
<dd>
"Logs in" to the active interpreter session. This is the password printed by
the Java interpreter prints out when invoked with the <i>-debug</i> option.

</dl>
</blockquote>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
<blockquote>
 
<dl>

<dt><b>CLASSPATH</b>
<dd>
Used to provide the system a path to user-defined classes. Directories are
separated by colons, for example,
<blockquote>
<pre>
.:/home/avh/classes:/usr/local/java/classes
</pre>
</blockquote>

</dl>
